# Frequently Asked Questions

_Question:_ Where do I put 'non side-effect' business logic?

_Answer:_ We don't really have a set convention, but [#1174](https://github.com/solidtechvn/SolidtechRN/issues/1174) should give you some ideas.

_Question:_ How do I upgrade an old SolidtechRN project's dependencies?

_Answer:_ It's still ReactNative ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯, but [#1124 may be what you're looking for.](https://github.com/solidtechvn/SolidtechRN/issues/1124)

_Question:_ Why is `SolidtechRN new MyProject` not using latest react-native?

_Answer:_ From [#1078](https://github.com/solidtechvn/SolidtechRN/issues/1078): Because SolidtechRN is a collection of components and those components all need to play nicely together. And sometimes they don't all cooperate when React Native's version increases.

_Question:_ What is a good non-trivial real world example of an SolidtechRN project?

_Answer:_ See the [ChainReact](https://github.com/solidtechvn/ChainReactApp) app for the React-Native conference of the same name. It was created by the authors of SolidtechRN.

_Question:_ What will the next Infinite Red SolidtechRN boilerplate be called?

# Creating Project Plugins

First read the [creating plugins guide](./creating-plugins.md). It covers the structure of plugins.

Project-based plugins are plugins which stay within your repo. They're a great way to add some features to SolidtechRN CLI without going through the hassle or commitment of publishing to NPM.

Some examples of this might be:

- generators that make little sense outside your project
- scripts that are a bit more complex than a one liner inside your `package.json`
- a playground for exploring SolidtechRN
- a proving arena for plugins you intend to build & release, but aren't quite ready yet

## The SolidtechRN/plugins Directory

You place your plugins in the `SolidtechRN/plugins` directory. Plugins are directories themselves, so begin by creating a `sample` directory there.

In this directory, create a file called `SolidtechRN.json` and put this empty object inside:

```json
{}
```

Next create a new text file in that directory, naming it `SolidtechRN.toml`. Inside, place this:

```toml
description = "ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ It's plugin time!ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥"
```

> Note! This will be replaced shortly with `SolidtechRN.json`. I just need to patch up gluegun to provide a post-load hook so SolidtechRN can do this.

## Running Your Plugin

Back in the project root, type:

```sh
$ SolidtechRN
```

You should see your plugin appear. Now, let's list the commands that you've made:

```sh
$ SolidtechRN sample
```

Empty. Let's make one by creating a new directory: `SolidtechRN/plugins/sample/commands`. In that directory place this `online.js`.

```javascript
// @cliDescription Let's gather some useful data on this mission!

module.exports = context => {
  const { filesystem, print } = context
  const { colors } = print

  const pkg = filesystem.read('package.json', 'json')
  const depsCount = Object.keys(pkg.dependencies || {}).length
  print.info(`You have ${colors.bold(depsCount)} direct dependencies. And they are awesome.`)
}
```

```sh
$ SolidtechRN sample
```

Now you have one. Let's run it.

```sh
$ SolidtechRN sample online
```
